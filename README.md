## About

This is Fedora packaging for [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io), cloned from the [official Fedora repo](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/goaccess) to provide versions for missing releases (such as EPEL 8).

## Builds

Builds are available on my Copr at https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/losuler/goaccess.

This repo can be added on all supported systems by:

```bash
dnf copr enable losuler/goaccess
```
